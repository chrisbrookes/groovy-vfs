== Bootstrap Gradle Plugin

From initiation a `VFS` object has been available as an extension to the project class.
The interface is very experimental and may change without much warning in future
releases of this plugin.

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        mavenCentral()
      }
      dependencies {
        classpath 'org.ysb33r.gradle:vfs-gradle-plugin:0.5.1'
        classpath 'commons-net:commons-net:3.+'  // If you want to use ftp
        classpath 'commons-httpclient:commons-httpclient:3.1' // If you want http/https
        classpath 'com.jcraft:jsch:0.1.48'  // If you want sftp
      }
}
apply plugin : 'org.ysb33r.vfs'

// Create a VFS task
task copyReadme << {
  vfs {
    cp 'https://raw.github.com/ysb33r/groovy-vfs/master/README.md', new File("${buildDir}/tmp/README.md")
  }
}

// it is also possible to update global options for vfs
vfs {
  options {
    http {
      maxTotalConnections 4
    }
  }
}

If you want to see what VFS is going run gradle with `--debug`

== VfsCopy

In 1.0 a copy task has been added.

[source,groovy]
----
import org.ysb33r.gradle.vfs.tasks.VfsCopy

task download ( type : VfsCopy ) {

    from 'http://somewhere.example/file' // <1>

    from 'http://somewhere.example/another_folder', {
      include '**/*.jpg' // <2>
    }

    from 'ftp://somewhere..else.example/folder', {
      options filter ~/\.jpg$/  // <3>
    }

    into new File(buildDir,'downloadedFolder') // <4>

    options { // <5>
      ftp {
        passiveMode true
      }
    }
}


----
<1> Copy this files
<2> Ant-style patterns are also supported
<3> Standard Groovy-VFS filter behaviour is achived via `options`
<4> Set the destination root URI. Files will be copied into that folder
<5> Set options for all of the copy operations. These override global options, but are only applicable for source and
  destination URLs within this task

=== Up to date checks

Performing an up to date check for a variety of remote filesystems can be tricky. Therefore the following logic is followed
in order to determine whether the task is out of date

* The destination root does not exist
* Any file from source does not exist in the destination hierarchy
* The source file is newer than the destination (folder timestamps are not checked)

NOTE: In beta-3, beta-4 input-output caching is not working as yet. https://github.com/ysb33r/groovy-vfs/issues/49[#49]. This
  was rectified in beta-5. IN was updated again in beta-7 https://github.com/ysb33r/groovy-vfs/issues/64[#64].

=== Copy optimisations

As long as both the source and the destination filesystems (schemes) support the ability to check modification time, only
files that are newer will be copied. If the modification time cannot be checked the copy will only occur if the destination
does not exist.

== Adding extra plugins

From v1.0 onwards additional plugins can be loaded via a new `extend` block. For more details see this gist:
