     * Returns the <em>real</em> path of an existing file.

     * <p> The precise definition of this method is implementation dependent but
     * in general it derives from this path, an {@link #isAbsolute absolute}
     * path that locates the {@link Files#isSameFile same} file as this path, but
     * with name elements that represent the actual name of the directories
     * and the file. For example, where filename comparisons on a file system
     * are case insensitive then the name elements represent the names in their
     * actual case. Additionally, the resulting path has redundant name
     * elements removed.
     *
     * <p> If this path is relative then its absolute path is first obtained,
     * as if by invoking the {@link #toAbsolutePath toAbsolutePath} method.
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
     * are handled. By default, symbolic links are resolved to their final
     * target. If the option {@link LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS NOFOLLOW_LINKS} is
     * present then this method does not resolve symbolic links.
     *
     * Some implementations allow special names such as "{@code ..}" to refer to
     * the parent directory. When deriving the <em>real path</em>, and a
     * "{@code ..}" (or equivalent) is preceded by a non-"{@code ..}" name then
     * an implementation will typically cause both names to be removed. When
     * not resolving symbolic links and the preceding name is a symbolic link
     * then the names are only removed if it guaranteed that the resulting path
     * will locate the same file as this path.
     *
     * @param options Ignored. RAM filesystem do not support links.

     * @return an absolute path represent the <em>real</em> path of the file
     *          located by this object
